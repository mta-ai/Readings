# Mount Allison Artificial Intelligence Society Readings
## Winter 2019, Week 9.

### Theme: Introduction to Neural Networks part 5.

#### Note: This week, Dr. Bruce Robertson will  be presenting his work on the Lace project, which "catalogues the results of our on-going campaign to produce high-quality OCR of polytonic, or 'ancient', Greek texts in a high-performance computing environment" ("Lace:" n.d., para. 1). The project allows readers to contribute corrections, and has over 12 million pages scanned so far. The lace project demonstrates both a practical and interesting application of computer vision technologies, and more broadly speaks to the nature of knowledge in a post internet world.
